# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
# Riccardo Spolaor is a Research Associate at the University of Oxford. He obtained his Ph.D. in Brain, Mind, and Computer Science at the University of Padua, Italy, in 2018. He obtained his Master's Degree in Computer Science in 2014 from the same university, with a thesis about smartphone privacy attack inferring user actions via traffic analysis. In November 2014, he started his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Mauro Conti. He has been a Visiting Ph.D. Student at Radboud University (2015), Ruhr-Universitat Bochum (2016), and University of Oxford (2016, 2017, and 2018). His main research interests are privacy and security issues on mobile devices. In particular, he applies machine learning techniques to infer user information relying on side-channel analysis. Most of the research that he carried out up to now is about the application of machine learning classifiers to network traffic and energy consumption traces.
