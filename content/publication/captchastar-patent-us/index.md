abstract: "A method to recognize whether a user of an electronic terminal is a human or a robot is described. This method provides to take an image and decompose the image in a multitude of image portions. The image portions are randomly visualized inside a test area of an electronic terminal. The method provides to detect the movement of a cursor inside the test area, and to move each image portion inside the test area according to a trajectory which depends on the position of the cursor inside the test area. When the cursor is in a solution position inside the test area, the image portions combine into the original image. The coordinates of the solution position are randomly generated, and to these coordinates is associated a solution area which comprises the coordinates of the solution position. In order to recognize if a user of an electronic terminal is a human or a robot, the method tests if the cursor position is inside the solution area when the user inputs a control signal."
