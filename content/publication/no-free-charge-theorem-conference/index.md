abstract: "More and more people are regularly using mobile and batterypowered handsets, such as smartphones and tablets. At the
same time, thanks to the technological innovation and to the
high user demands, those devices are integrating extensive
functionalities and developers are writing battery-draining
apps, which results in a surge of energy consumption of
these devices. This scenario leads many people to often look
for opportunities to charge their devices at public charging
stations: the presence of such stations is already prominent
around public areas such as hotels, shopping malls, airports,
gyms and museums, and is expected to significantly grow in
the future. While most of the time the power comes for
free, there is no guarantee that the charging station is not
maliciously controlled by an adversary, with the intention to
exfiltrate data from the devices that are connected to it.
In this paper, we illustrate for the first time how an adversary could leverage a maliciously controlled charging station
to exfiltrate data from the smartphone via a USB charging
cable (i.e., without using the data transfer functionality),
controlling a simple app running on the device—and without requiring any permission to be granted by the user to
send data out of the device. We show the feasibility of the
proposed attack through a prototype implementation in Android, which is able to send out potentially sensitive information, such as IMEI, contacts’ phone number, and pictures."
