abstract: "Over the last years, most websites on which users
can register (e.g., email providers and social networks) adopted
CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell
Computers and Humans Apart) as a countermeasure against
automated attacks. The battle of wits between designers and
attackers of CAPTCHAs led to current ones being annoying and
hard to solve for users, while still being vulnerable to automated
attacks.
In this paper, we propose CAPTCHaStar, a new image-based
CAPTCHA that relies on user interaction. This novel CAPTCHA
leverages the innate human ability to recognize shapes in a
confused environment. We assess the effectiveness of our proposal
for the two key aspects for CAPTCHAs, i.e., usability, and
resiliency to automated attacks. In particular, we evaluated the
usability, carrying out a thorough user study, and we tested the
resiliency of our proposal against several types of automated
attacks: traditional ones; designed ad-hoc for our proposal; and
based on machine learning. Compared to the state of the art,
our proposal is more user friendly (e.g., only some 35% of the
users prefer current solutions, such as text-based CAPTCHAs)
and more resilient to automated attacks.
