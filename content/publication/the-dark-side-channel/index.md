abstract: "In recent years, mobile devices (e.g., smartphones
and tablets) have met an increasing commercial success and
have become a fundamental element of the everyday life for
billions of people all around the world. Mobile devices are
used not only for traditional communication activities (e.g., voice
calls and messages) but also for more advanced tasks made
possible by an enormous amount of multi-purpose applications
(e.g., finance, gaming, and shopping). As a result, those devices
generate a significant network traffic (a consistent part of the
overall Internet traffic). For this reason, the research community
has been investigating security and privacy issues that are related
to the network traffic generated by mobile devices, which could
be analyzed to obtain information useful for a variety of goals
(ranging from fine-grained user profiling to device security and
network optimization).
In this paper, we review the works that contributed to the
state of the art of network traffic analysis targeting mobile
devices. In particular, we present a systematic classification of
the works in the literature according to three criteria: (i) the
goal of the analysis; (ii) the point where the network traffic
is captured; and (iii) the targeted mobile platforms. In this
survey, we consider points of capturing such as Wi-Fi access
points, software simulation, and inside real mobile devices or
emulators. For the surveyed works, we review and compare
analysis techniques, validation methods, and achieved results. We
also discuss possible countermeasures, challenges, and possible
directions for future research on mobile traffic analysis and
other emerging domains (e.g., Internet of Things). We believe our
survey will be a reference work for researchers and practitioners
in this research field."
